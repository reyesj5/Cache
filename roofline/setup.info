Steps:
1. Get roofline code from repository
2. Change the configuration files depending on which compiler and linker/loader will be used.
	a. Using mpicc as a wrapper for mpi in gcc
	b. using -fopenmp to direct compiler to openmp
	c. Changing the Results to a specified relative directory
3. Install java 8 or newer
	a. sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless
	b. sudo apt-get install default-jre
	c. sudo apt-get install default-jdk
	d. I had the issue that the "canberra-gtk-module" was not installed correctly, or did not have the 32-bit version. This was fixed with the following commands:
		sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module:i386
		sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module
